# Snake-Path

This snake game consists of a regular snake game, where snake will have to eat fruits to grow, while being confined to the boundaries, and either bite itself or hit the walls of boundary to get knocked out. In this game, I have added to new concepts:-
1. Just like fruits emerge, obstacles will emerge and stay in the game, which if hit by the snake, the game gets over. The obstacles will be spawned after a regular period of time.
2. A moving obstacle will emerge regularly, at random positions, and snake would have to avoid this obstacle in order for the game to be continued.

3. Fruits are in red, obstacles are in pink and blue. Snake is in greensih shade.
